# Solar Power Generation

## Dataset

This project utilizes the [Solar Power Generation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data) from `Kaggle`.

## Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing is essential to clean and prepare the data for modeling. The steps are outlined below:

### Load the Data

Using `pandas`, both generation and weather sensor data for Plant 1 and Plant 2 are loaded and inspected.

---

#### Key Columns in the Dataset:

- **`DATE_TIME`**: Timestamp for each record. Can be used to derive time-based features like `HOUR`, `DAY_OF_WEEK`, or `MONTH` to uncover temporal patterns.
- **`PLANT_ID`**: Unique identifier for the solar power plant. Excluded from modeling as it doesn’t aid prediction.
- **`SOURCE_KEY`**: Identifies a specific data source or sensor. Similar to `PLANT_ID`, excluded from predictive features.
- **`DC_POWER`**: Direct Current power output from solar panels (raw generation data).
- **`AC_POWER`**: Alternating Current power output after conversion from DC. This is the target variable (`y`), as it reflects usable energy.
- **`DAILY_YIELD`**: Energy generated by the plant in one day up to the given timestamp.
- **`TOTAL_YIELD`**: Cumulative energy generated by the plant over time.
- **`AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE`**: Air temperature around the solar plant, which can impact panel efficiency.
- **`MODULE_TEMPERATURE`**: Temperature of the solar modules, typically higher than ambient temperature.
- **`IRRADIATION`**: Solar radiation reaching the panels, a crucial feature for prediction.

---

#### Key Features for Modeling (`X`):

- `DC_POWER`, `AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE`, `MODULE_TEMPERATURE`, `IRRADIATION`, and time-based features derived from `DATE_TIME`.

#### Target Variable (`y`):

- `AC_POWER`.

#### Excluded Features:

- `PLANT_ID`, `SOURCE_KEY`, `DAILY_YIELD`, `TOTAL_YIELD` (not predictive).

### Preprocessing Steps:

1. **Convert Date-Time Column**:
   Transform `DATE_TIME` into a datetime format for both datasets.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   Use plots to explore data distributions and trends.

3. **Merge Data**:
   Combine generation and weather data for each plant based on `DATE_TIME`.

4. **Combine Plant Datasets**:
   Concatenate Plant 1 and Plant 2 datasets into a single dataset.

5. **Handle Missing Values**:
   Check for and address missing values. Since this dataset has no missing values, this step is skipped.

6. **Feature Engineering**:
   Create time-based features like `hour`, `day of the week`, and `month` from `DATE_TIME`.

7. **Drop Unnecessary Columns**:
   Remove non-predictive columns such as `PLANT_ID` and `SOURCE_KEY`.

8. **Normalize/Standardize Features**:
   Scale features like power outputs and temperatures for consistency.

9. **Define Features and Target**:
   Separate the feature matrix (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).

10. **Split Data**:
    Partition the dataset into training and testing subsets to validate the model's performance.

## Model Selection

The project explores three regression models:

1. **Linear Regression**:
   A basic model predicting the target as a weighted sum of input features.

2. **Decision Tree Regressor**:
   A tree-based model that splits data iteratively on feature values.

3. **MLP Regressor**:
   A neural network capturing complex, non-linear relationships.

### Training and Evaluation

Models are trained on the training dataset, and their performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.

### Performance Results:

| Model             | MAE    | MSE      | R²     |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ------ |
| Linear Regression | 0.1948 | 0.1668   | 0.8337 |
| Decision Tree     | 0.0007 | 0.000088 | 0.9999 |
| MLP Regressor     | 0.0548 | 0.0123   | 0.9877 |

### Commentary:

1. **Linear Regression**:

   - **Performance**: High errors and the lowest R² score.
   - **Pros**: Simple and interpretable.
   - **Cons**: Limited to linear relationships.
   - **Conclusion**: Outperformed by non-linear models.

2. **Decision Tree Regressor**:

   - **Performance**: Outstanding with negligible errors and an almost perfect R² score.
   - **Pros**: Handles non-linear patterns well, fast training.
   - **Cons**: Prone to overfitting without proper tuning.
   - **Conclusion**: Effective but benefits from ensemble techniques.

3. **MLP Regressor**:
   - **Performance**: Moderate errors and strong R² score.
   - **Pros**: Captures non-linear relationships, effective with complex data.
   - **Cons**: Requires significant computational resources and careful tuning.
   - **Conclusion**: Balances complexity and accuracy but not as efficient as tree-based methods.

### Final Results:

Evaluation results are displayed in a clear, tabular format for easy comparison. This workflow highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each model, guiding the choice of the most appropriate approach for solar power prediction.
